# Features
The library is in its early stages and built simply so that I could automate Firewall tasks when using DNS blocking services such as Unlocator.
The following features have been implemented:
* Login
* Get Device Info
* Get/Set Firewall levels
* Get Firewall custom rules
* Getting WAN network status

Todo:
* Set Firewall custom rules (create new IP blocking rules)
